# Detection of Lymph Node Metastases in Women With Breast Cancer

## Overview

This repository cointains a solution to the [CAMELYON16](https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/Home/) challenge. The goal of this challenge was to develop an algorithm to detect cancer in digital slides of lymph node tissue.

## Motivation

To detect the presence of cancer on a slide containing lymph node tissue, a pathologist must spend a greta deal of time analyzing the specifem under a microsope. This task is time consuming and subject to human error. With advancments in deep learning, an automted solution could be developed to analyze slides more effciently and objectivley. 

## Medical Background

Lymph node metastases occur in most cancer types (e.g. breast, prostate, colon). Lymph nodes are small glands that filter lymph, the fluid that circulates through the lymphatic system. The lymph nodes in the underarm are the first place breast cancer is likely to spread. Metastatic involvement of lymph nodes is one of the most important prognostic variables in breast cancer.
